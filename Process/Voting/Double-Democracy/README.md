# Double Democracy

The Double Democracy rules define two kinds of votes, corrective and constructive, to be employed in different contexts.
See Tom W. Bell's ["What Can Corporations Teach Governments About Democratic Equality?"](SSRN_ID2648523_code789050.pdf) for context and rationale.

## Corrective Vote (one-person/one-vote, 1P/1V)

The one-person/one-vote approach popular in political contexts works best at protecting the individual personal rights to which all players have an equal claim. 

## Constructive Vote (one-share/one-vote, 1S/1V)

Corporate lawâ€™s one-share/one-vote rule works best at protecting the property rights of those who invest in a commonly owned asset or project.
